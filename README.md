# oh-my-antigravity

**The Ultimate Agentic Toolkit for Google Gemini Antigravity.**

*Ported from [oh-my-claudecode](https://github.com/yeachan-heo/oh-my-claudecode) with ❤️*

> Give your Antigravity agent the collective intelligence of the "Oh My" ecosystem with **72 specialized Skills** and **35 automated Workflows**.

**✅ Migration Status**: Complete - Antigravity-ready ✅  
**📊 Compatibility**: 72/72 Skills ✅ | 35/35 Workflows ✅ | 0 Issues  
**📖 See**: [Migration Status Report](MIGRATION_STATUS.md) | [Migration Plan](MIGRATION_TO_ANTIGRAVITY.md)

---

## ✅ Migration Complete

This project is fully migrated to Google Antigravity:

- ✅ **Skills & Workflows**: All content reviewed for Antigravity compatibility
- ✅ **Hooks Replacement**: Legacy hooks converted to Workflows + `GEMINI.md` rules
- ✅ **Installation Scripts**: Use `~/.gemini/antigravity/` paths

## ✨ What is oh-my-antigravity?

oh-my-antigravity is a comprehensive collection of AI agent "personas" (Skills) and automated procedures (Workflows) designed to supercharge your development workflow with Google's Antigravity AI coding assistant.

Think of it as:
- 🧠 **Skills** = Expert personas your agent can embody (architect, security-reviewer, scientist...)
- ⚡️ **Workflows** = Slash commands that trigger automated procedures (`/autopilot`, `/swarm`, `/ultrawork`...)

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Local Installation (Per Project)

Copy the `.agent` directory to your project:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/oh-my-antigravity.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd oh-my-antigravity

# Run the installer (installs to current directory by default)
./install.sh /path/to/your/project
```

### Option 2: Global Installation (All Projects)

Install globally so all projects can access the skills and workflows:

```bash
# Run the global installer
./install_global.sh
```

This installs to:
- Skills → `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/`
- Workflows (canonical) → `~/.gemini/antigravity/global_workflows/`
- Workflows (compat discovery links) → `~/.agent/workflows/`, `~/.agents/workflows/`, `~/_agent/workflows/`, `~/_agents/workflows/`

---

## 🎮 Usage

### Using Skills

Just ask naturally! Skills are automatically recognized:

```
"Act as an architect and design a microservices system."
"Run a security review on this file."
"Deepsearch the root cause of this bug."
"Be a frontend-ui-ux expert and improve this component."
```

### Using Workflows

Trigger workflows with slash commands:

```

### Rules (GEMINI.md)

Add project rules in `GEMINI.md` and global rules in `~/.gemini/antigravity/GEMINI.md`.
/autopilot Build a REST API for user authentication
/ultrawork Implement all pending features in parallel
/aireview Review the last 5 commits
/doctor Check if my environment is set up correctly
/help Show me all available commands
```

## 🔧 Requirements

- **Google Antigravity** (Gemini-powered AI coding assistant)
- **CLI Tools** (recommended for enhanced functionality):
  - `fd` - Fast file finder
  - `rg` (ripgrep) - Fast text search
  - `sg` (ast-grep) - Structural code search

Run `/doctor` to verify your environment setup.

## 🛡️ Skill Governance

This repository includes a governance policy and checker for Skills + Workflows in Antigravity IDE:

- Policy: `docs/SKILL_GOVERNANCE.md`
- Checker: `scripts/check-skill-governance.sh`
- Debt allowlist: `.governance/skill-lint.allowlist`

Run governance check:

```bash
bash scripts/check-skill-governance.sh
```

## 📌 Governance Status (2026-02-06)

- Governance check result: `0 issues`, `0 allowlisted debt`
- Runtime-incompatible task syntax removed from active skills/workflows
- Deprecated migration in place:
  - `learn-about-omc` (deprecated) -> `learn-about-oma` (canonical)
