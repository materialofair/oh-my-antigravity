# Update Codemaps


## Native Subagent Protocol (Codex)

Codex supports native subagents. Delegate with `spawn_agent`, coordinate with `send_input`, collect via `wait`, and clean up with `close_agent`.

Execution preference:
1. Use native subagents first for independent workstreams (parallel when possible).
2. Merge results in main thread and run final verification.
3. Fallback only when delegation is blocked: use the `[ANALYST]`/`[ARCHITECT]`/`[EXECUTOR]`/`[REVIEWER]` structure in a single response.

Minimal orchestration pattern:
```text
spawn_agent -> send_input (optional) -> wait -> close_agent
```

Analyze the codebase structure and update architecture documentation:

1. Scan all source files for imports, exports, and dependencies
2. Generate token-lean codemaps in the following format:
   - codemaps/architecture.md - Overall architecture
   - codemaps/backend.md - Backend structure  
   - codemaps/frontend.md - Frontend structure
   - codemaps/data.md - Data models and schemas

3. Calculate diff percentage from previous version
4. If changes > 30%, request user approval before updating
5. Add freshness timestamp to each codemap
6. Save reports to .reports/codemap-diff.txt

Use TypeScript/Node.js for analysis. Focus on high-level structure, not implementation details.
