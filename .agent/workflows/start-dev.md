# start-dev - Intelligent Development Workflow

Execute complete Research → Plan → Implement workflow with automatic pattern library loading and intelligent codebase understanding.

## Quick Usage

```bash
start-dev <feature description>           # Standard execution
start-dev --no-explore <feature>          # Force skip exploration
start-dev --force-explore <feature>       # Force deep exploration
start-dev --frontend <feature>            # Force frontend patterns
start-dev --backend <feature>             # Force backend patterns
```

## Steps

1. Read the start-dev skill:
   - `view_file` on `.agent/skills/start-dev/SKILL.md`

2. Follow the skill instructions to execute:
   - **Phase 0A**: Pattern Library Loading (auto-detects frontend/backend)
   - **Phase 0B**: Codebase Exploration (conditional)
   - **Phase 1**: Research (version-accurate documentation)
   - **Phase 2**: Planning (multi-approach comparison)
   - **Phase 3**: Implementation (TDD with pattern guidance)
   - **Phase 4**: Quality Review (three-dimension assurance)
   - **Phase 5**: Knowledge Capture (pattern learning)

3. Key features:
   - Auto-detects task type (frontend/backend/full-stack)
   - Loads relevant pattern libraries (631-1218 lines)
   - Quality gates at each phase transition
   - Circuit breaker for error handling
   - Pattern compliance checking

4. Output:
   - Complete project report with pattern metrics
   - All artifacts (ResearchPack, ImplementationPlan, etc.)
   - Quality scores and pattern compliance

## Output

- Produce a concrete deliverable in markdown aligned with the workflow/skill goal.
- Include key decisions, actions taken, and final status for Antigravity IDE visibility.
