# Learn About OMA

Use the `learn-about-oma` skill as the canonical usage-analysis workflow.

1. Read `.agent/skills/learn-about-oma/SKILL.md`.
2. Collect available usage data from local OMA state.
3. Produce actionable recommendations prioritized by impact.

## Output

- Provide a usage summary with key signals (frequency, mode usage, friction points).
- Provide prioritized recommendations with expected impact and effort.
- Include missing-data notes when telemetry/state files are unavailable.
